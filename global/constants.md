# Globally Defined Constants

***

## Overview

Constants defines fixed values for application path, database return &amp; result modes, and other application flags. Constants are immutable values set once and remain unchanged at runtime.

***

## Introduction

Global constants are immutable values that remain the same throughout the entire application lifecycle. Unlike regular variables, constants cannot be changed at runtime, providing reliability and consistency in the applicationâ€™s behavior.

They are commonly used to define reusable values such as configuration settings, environment flags, directory paths, and other predefined values. Giving meaningful names to constants improves code readability, maintainability, and clarity by clearly conveying the purpose of each value.

---

### Scope

Constants are accessible from anywhere in the application, making them ideal for values shared across multiple modules. In Luminova, constants are typically defined in `/bootstrap/constants.php` and are loaded before any other module, ensuring they are available globally from the start of execution.

### Status Codes

- `STATUS_SUCCESS` **(int)**: - Status code indicating the operation was successful.  
  > **Recommended when:** You want to continue the normal application flow after a successful process.

- `STATUS_ERROR` **(int)**: - Status code indicating the operation failed.  
  > **Recommended when:** A critical error occurs that requires stopping the current process or returning an error response.

- `STATUS_SILENCE` **(int)**: - Status code indicating the operation may have failed but was handled gracefully without interrupting the application.  
  > **Recommended when:** You want to suppress the error visibly, respond with a custom error details or continue without showing a failure message.
