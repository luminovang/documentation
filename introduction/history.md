# History of Luminova Framework

## Overview

A Brief History of the PHP Luminova Framework: Its Journey from a Collection of PHP Libraries to a Full-Fledged Framework in the real world.

## Introduction

### 2017

In 2017, Luminova started as a collection of libraries aimed at simplifying web development, which it includes libraries like [PHP Router Template](https://github.com/peterujah/php-router-template), [PHP Functions](https://github.com/peterujah/php-functions), [Database Controller](https://github.com/peterujah/db-controller), [Output Compressor](https://github.com/peterujah/ob-compress), [Search Controller](https://github.com/peterujah/php-search-controller), [Nano Image](https://github.com/peterujah/nano-image), and [Filesystem Cache](https://github.com/peterujah/cache). Many of these legacy libraries are still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterujah/) today, with some actively maintained and others integrated into the current Luminova framework, either optimized or rewritten to serve as its backbone.

### 2018

In 2018, these various components was brought together by Ujah Chigozie Peter (CEO of Nanoblock Technology Ltd). Initially, it was more of a web development kit. Over time, more features were added, making it versatile but still lacking the abstraction and modularity necessary to be considered a full-fledged framework, as it lacks installation and update support through composer with other features, also minor manual modification is alway required for every project it being used for.

### 2021

In 2021, the journey to transform it into a stable and reusable web development kit began. It remained a private tool for NanoBlock, and though it wasn't perfect, but it was highly effective for building medium web applications and API's. But it was still lacking documentation and modularity.

### 2023

By 2023, out of curiosity, consistency and a passion for open-source projects, the name PHP Luminova Framework was born and major optimization and new features was introduced giving it all it was lacking such as official documentation and usage guides, Model, CRUD Helper, Model View Controller (MVC), Routing system, CLI tool and many more. It was made publicly available on GitHub with support for installable and updatable through PHP's Composer package manager under Github organization [NanoBlock](https://github.com/nanoblocktech/luminova).

### 2024

In early 2024, Luminova was moved to its own organization, [Luminova Ng](https://github.com/luminovang/luminova). Significant optimizations were made to both the documentation and the Luminova codebase. New components and features were introduced, including the Hierarchical Model View Controller (HMVC), PHP Attribute Routing, Database Migration and Seeding Helper, Cron Task Helper, Version-Controlled Page Caching, HTTP Server, Process Executor, Document Builder, and many others.

Luminova framework was written for performance in the real world and is still maintained by NanoBlock till date.
