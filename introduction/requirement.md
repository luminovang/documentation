## Overview

Requirements to develop an application using PHP Luminova Framework, ensure that your environment meets the basic requirements for smooth coding.

***

Before starting a development, it's important to have a clear idea of the application you want to build. Define the purpose, functionality, and target audience of your application. Having a well-defined user application idea will guide the design and development process, ensuring that your application meets the needs of its users effectively. 

In addition to a clear vision, you'll need to ensure your development and production environment is properly equipped to handle the requirements of your application and the Framework. Here's what you'll need.

### PHP Version

Luminova Framework requires PHP version `8.0` or higher. Ensure that your server or development environment has PHP8 installed and configured correctly.

### Composer

Composer, a dependency manager for PHP, is essential for managing dependencies required by both Luminova and your application. It simplifies the process of installing and updating third-party dependencies, ensuring your project stays up to date.

### Web Server

If you intend to deploy your application online for production, you'll need a web server to host it. Popular choices include Apache, Nginx, or you can utilize PHP's built-in web server for development purposes, which is integrated within the Luminova framework.

> *Note:* For applications that utilize databases such as `MySQL` or `MySQLi,` you may require a development server like XAMPP or WAMP.

### Database

Luminova is compatible with various database systems including `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, and more. Ensure that your chosen database server is installed and accessible from your PHP environment.

### Operating System

Luminova is compatible with most operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Choose the operating system that best suits your development environment.

### Extensions

Check that all necessary PHP extensions are enabled. Luminova may require extensions such as PDO, OpenSSL, Mbstring, JSON, etc., depending on the modules you intend to utilize in your application.
