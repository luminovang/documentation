# Luminova Documentation

![Local Image](https://github.com/luminovang/luminova/raw/main/docs/logo.svg)

This repository contains the full documentation for the **[Luminova PHP Framework](https://luminova.ng)**.
It is written in simple, practical language and structured for developers who prefer clarity over noise.

The documentation explains how to install, configure, extend, and maintain applications built with Luminova.
It covers everything from routing and controllers to caching, **Novakit CLI** tools, validation, schema rules, performance profiling, and advanced features introduced in newer releases.

## About Luminova

Luminova is a lightweight, fast PHP framework focused on:

* Clear routing
* Simple controllers
* Predictable request/response handling
* Flexible caching (FileCache, MemoryCache, DB)
* A clean app structure (MVC or HMVC)
* Optional features toggled through environment flags
* Practical tools for real-world projects
* Minimal magic — you always see what the framework is doing

## Contributing

If you want to help improve the documentation:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your update.

## Editing the Documentation

All docs are plain Markdown.
Use simple English, short sentences, and examples that solve real problems.

When making changes:

* Keep sentences readable.
* Stay consistent with existing structure.
* Avoid jargon unless the framework itself requires it.
* Document features based strictly on **[https://luminova.ng](https://luminova.ng)**.
* Do not mix concepts from other frameworks.

## Building / Publishing

If you want to regenerate or rebuild a static site from the docs (using MkDocs, VuePress, Astro, or anything else), create a separate build environment outside this repo.
This repository should only store the Markdown source files.

## Issues

If you find mistakes, unclear explanations, or missing topics, open an issue.
Bug reports must reference the exact page and section so it’s easy to locate and correct.

## License

The documentation is open for reading and contribution, but the Luminova framework itself may carry its own license.
